This data contains 3 important metrics: star rating, answer percentage, and linear mean value. Of these metrics, the star rating is a 1-5 star rating given by the CMS as part of their initiative to make their Compare Web sites more intuitive. The answer percentage is the distribution of answers within each question. Most of the questions have “Always”, “Usually”, and “Sometimes or Never” as possible answers. The linear mean value is the metric that will be used for this analysis. This metric is an adjusted score accounting for patient mix, survey mode, and quarterly weighting.

    "text": "Conclusion\nOur analysis has shown us that these are the factors that contribute to a change in a hospitals recommendation score. For example, if all other components are held constant, a change in principal component 2 will significantly affect a hospitals recommendation score. It is important to note that each subsequent component accounts for less of the overall variance between hospitals. This means that in descending order, when accurately interpreted, principal component 1 will account for fluctuation in the recommendation score the most, and principal component 8 will account for it the least. This analysis provides insights on what people value from hospitals, and what hospitals can do to provide better care.\n\nLimitations\nThere are a few limitations and ethical concerns that should be mentioned. These insights should not be used as a means of justification for hospitals to de-prioritze certain aspects of care in hopes of a better recommendation score. Not only would this be ineffective considering principle component 1, it would also have the potential to actively harm individuals. Another thing to consider is the reliability of the data. Hospital admins generally care a lot about how their hospital is rated. So much so, that some hospitals might not report accurate data. While the data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid should be reliable, it is important to note the possibility of data tampering."
