    "text": "This project aims to analyze hospital survey data to determine what effects a hospital’s overall rating. The hospital data that will be used was retrieved from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) website. This data was accessed on April 10th, 2025 and contains data from 2023 - 2024 from a multitude of different hospitals. This data contains 3 important metrics: star rating, answer percentage, and linear mean value. Of these metrics, the star rating is a 1-5 star rating given by the CMS as part of their initiative to make their Compare Web sites more intuitive. The answer percentage is the distribution of answers within each question. Most of the questions have “Always”, “Usually”, and “Sometimes or Never” as possible answers. The linear mean value is the metric that will be used for this analysis. This metric is an adjusted score accounting for patient mix, survey mode, and quarterly weighting. More details can be found here.\n\n\n\nBefore we create the model, we must first clean the data. Since only survey data is being considered, location data will not be included in this analysis. After isolating the linear mean values, we will fit a model using principle component analysis. Since our goal is inference, we already know we want to include all components, and we are not evaluating model predictions, we will not be creating a holdout set. After the model is created, we will look at the p-values of each component to determine how significant each component is."
