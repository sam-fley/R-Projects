I am a Mathematics graduate from California State University, Fullerton, with a strong interest in data science and its applications in solving real-world problems. My academic background provides a solid foundation in statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, and algorithmic thinking. I primarily work with R and have some experience with Python, using both to explore data, build models, and create visualizations. This website features my coding projects and reflects my passion for data-driven discovery and continuous learning in the field of data science.
